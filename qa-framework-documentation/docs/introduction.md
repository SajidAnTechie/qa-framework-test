# Introduction

QA Framework is designed to help Leapfrog QA's by automating a desired website.

## Purpose

Automation is hard. For a full automation testing of a website, you need to know quite a bit. Namely cypress/selenium, javascript, command line, packages, servers, and so on. Let's not forget project pressures(**PM's** & **TL's** pinging you). 

QA Framework tries to reduce the work by:
* Having everything a QA needs in Excel(literally everything)
* Easy to understand and micro list of commands
* Easy menu buttons under **QA Framework** to start your test
* Environment configuration *(Under development)*
* Reuseable Functions *(Under development)*
* Zero Setup

## What you'll need

Even though the framework is easy to use, there are some basic readings you will need.

- [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath)
- [Css Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- Inspecting elements in browser
- Excel


## Limitations

Currently, we are only supporting chromium based browsers. We will be adding other browsers in the future.
