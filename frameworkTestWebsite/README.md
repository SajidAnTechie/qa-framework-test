# Framework Test Website

Because we are developing a library/framework, we need a website against which we can test our commands. This website is needed because most of general purpose websites won't have all the conditions we will need to test our framework.

## Setup
You can use any commandline utility that serves static html files. You can also use VSCode extenstions like **Live Server**.

## Notes
1. The website needs to be simple, static and use very few library
2. Every element on the page should have some usability for testing the framework. Don't add any unnecessary html.
3. Keep things simple and minimalistic.
4. This website will be used to train QA's on the framework functionality
