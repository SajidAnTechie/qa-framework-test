# System Introduction

This repository contains the code from our "App Script". This does nothing and is intented for version control and code reivew purposes only.

## When changing app script do

* The file extension is changed from .gs to .js so as to enable syntax highlighting.
* Copy the files you changed to this repository in the same filename inside **src/** directory.
* Send a pull request
* Don't mix changes from other repository(qa-client, qa-framework, etc) in appscript changes(strictly).
* Prefix the commits with **App-Script** so that we can look into git history easily if needed.
